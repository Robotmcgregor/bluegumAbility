        <!-- <h1>Bluegum Ability Services (BAS) Transition Procedure</h1> -->
    <p>Bluegum Ability Services (BAS) recognizes that exiting and transitioning can be a complex and stressful process for the individuals we support and their families. BAS is committed to providing a well-planned and professional transition process. This procedure applies to individuals who decide to move to another service provider.</p>

    <p>As an NDIS-funded Disability Support provider, BAS has certain obligations to ensure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A well-coordinated and individualized transition to a new provider or the community, facilitated with the individual's support network. The transition plan must be clearly documented, communicated, and managed effectively.</li>
        <li>Any risks associated with the transition are identified, documented, and addressed.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <h2>Transition for Clients Exiting BAS Services</h2>
    <p>When someone we support is considering leaving BAS or transitioning to another provider, our staff will meet with the individual and their support network to understand the reasons behind this decision. The goal is to identify any concerns and explore whether adjustments to their current services could resolve the issues.</p>

    <p>BAS staff will assist the person in exploring whether:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reshaping their current support arrangements could help them stay with BAS.</li>
        <li>Increased personal capacity might support a lower level of service.</li>
        <li>Alternative services or activities within BAS could better meet their needs.</li>
        <li>The exit is due to a natural completion of services, such as Support Coordination.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Throughout this process, we respect the individual's right to choice and control over their supports and services. If the person, along with their support network, decides to exit BAS, we will support them in exploring alternative services.</p>

    <h2>Transition Planning</h2>
    <h3>Developing a Transition Plan</h3>
    <p>A well-thought-out transition plan is essential to ensure a smooth transition. This plan should include details about the individual’s new service arrangements, living space (e.g., housemates and location), and contact information for the new provider’s staff. The plan should also document key community supports the individual already accesses.</p>

    <h3>Additional Support Requirements and Modifications</h3>
    <p>The new service provider must receive all relevant information promptly to make necessary arrangements before the individual begins receiving services. This includes modifications such as bedroom adjustments, vehicle access, arrival of equipment, safeguarding, health and behavior support, and staff training requirements.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the Local Community</h3>
    <p>An important part of the transition is introducing the individual to their new environment, including housemates, staff, and the local community. This can take place over several visits, depending on the individual’s needs and available support. Ideally, BAS will collaborate with the new provider to facilitate this process.</p>

    <h3>Maintaining Relationships, Friendships, and Community Connections</h3>
    <p>Whenever possible, we encourage a process for saying goodbye to other BAS clients, staff, service providers, neighbors, and local community members, especially when moving to a new community. Established friendships and connections should be supported to continue, whether through email, virtual meetings, phone contact, or visits.</p>

    <h3>Change of Address</h3>
    <p>It is crucial to notify other service providers of the individual’s change of address, such as the NDIS, Centrelink, health professionals, Behavior Support professionals, banks, etc., to ensure they can continue contacting the individual when necessary.</p>

    <h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
    <p>With the individual’s consent, relevant support documents can be shared with the new service provider to ensure a seamless continuation of support. If the person does not consent, they should be provided with a copy of their key support documents for future use.</p>

    <h3>Exiting the Person from BAS Operational Systems</h3>
    <p>To complete the transition, the operational exit process must be carried out to remove the individual from BAS systems. This ensures that data and reporting remain accurate and that individuals are not charged for services they no longer receive. BAS will manage the individual’s information in accordance with its Privacy and Confidentiality Policy.</p>

    <h3>Feedback Process</h3>
    <p>Once an individual has exited, BAS staff will send them the NDIS BAS 804 Exit – Client Feedback Form (or the NDIS BAS 805 Exit – Client Feedback Form Easy English), which they and/or their family can complete if they wish. These forms can be completed anonymously and returned to the Disability Staff Support Centre (DSSC). The DSSC will handle local feedback as needed and consolidate it at a national level. BAS uses this feedback to improve future service delivery and to identify any necessary policy or practice changes.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, clients may provide feedback directly to BAS via the national feedback and complaints process.</p>
